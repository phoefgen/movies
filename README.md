# movies
An experiment, inspired by the udacity full stack dev course.

This project works by:

1) Taking a hard coded list of movies.
2) Queries those movies against the http://www.omdbapi.com movie database API for movie poster links, and text fields.
3) Queries the http://trailersapi.com for youtube links to movie trailers
4) generates a webpage dynamically with that information, and the details of all the movies submitted. 

Installation Notes:

None, only standard libraries and the included class files are installed.Simply clone to a local directory, and run "mediacentre.py"

This will actively hit the API's and generate the content for the page in realtime.

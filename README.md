# movies
An experiment, inspired by the udacity full stack dev course.

<h2>This project works by:<h2>

1) Taking a hard coded list of movies.<br>
2) Queries those movies against the http://www.omdbapi.com movie database API for movie poster links, and text fields.<br>
3) Queries the http://trailersapi.com for youtube links to movie trailers<br>
4) generates a webpage dynamically with that information, and the details of all the movies submitted. <br>

<h2>Installation Notes:<h2>

None, only standard libraries and the included class files are installed.Simply clone to a local directory, and run "mediacentre.py"<br>

This will actively hit the API's and generate the content for the page in realtime. <br>
